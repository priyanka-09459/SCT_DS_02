# 📊 SkillCraft Data Science Project – Task 2

This repository contains **Task 2** of the SkillCraft Data Science internship project. In this task, we analyzed the **Population of India** dataset, focusing on urban-rural distributions, sex ratios, density, and demographic trends using Python.

## 📌 Objective

- Clean and preprocess a real-world dataset on population demographics  
- Analyze rural vs. urban distribution across Indian states/UTs  
- Visualize key variables like population density and sex ratio  
- Derive insights about gender disparity and demographic concentration

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Highlights

- Removed extra symbols and converted all numeric columns properly  
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency  
- Created new columns like `Rural_Percent` and `Urban_Percent`  
- Handled missing values, formatting issues, and type conversion

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- **Correlation Matrix** of population-related variables  
- **Top 10 Most Populated States**  
- **Rural vs. Urban Population Percentages**  
- **State-wise Population Density**  
- **Sex Ratio Distribution**  
- **Area vs Population Correlation**

## 📈 Insights

- States like **Uttar Pradesh** and **Maharashtra** have the highest populations.
- Some northeastern states showed a **higher sex ratio**, while some urban-heavy states had a lower ratio.
- **Urban-Rural imbalance** is more evident in densely populated regions.
- **Area and population** are highly correlated with a coefficient of ~0.99.
